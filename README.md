Hi!

Everything I present today will be referenced from this readme. I host all files and documents on github using 'pages' (e.g. this readme: https://mluerig.github.io/RR/README.md).

Additionally there will be some apps published on shiny (e.g.: https://luerig.shinyapps.io/Sample_001a) and on my personal homepage (http://www.luerig.net/files/rr). 

I hope that by the time of my talk this repository will be in a shape that allows you to simply fork it and run the code along with my presentation.
