Hi!

**Please check the dowloads section first**

Everything I present will be referenced from this readme. I host all files and documents on github using 'pages' (e.g. this readme: https://mluerig.github.io/RR/README.md).

Additionally there will be some apps published on shiny (e.g.: https://luerig.shinyapps.io/Sample_001a) and on my personal homepage (http://www.luerig.net/files/rr). 

I hope that by the time of my talk this repository will be in a shape that allows you to simply fork it and run the code along with my presentation.

**R** 
I assume you have R and Rstudio installed       
```
install.packages(c("rmarkdown","knitr" ,"ggplot2","shiny","plotly", "rgl", "rggobi"))
```

**Python (3.6)** 
if you have yet to intall python I recommend https://conda.io/miniconda.html. To install packages go to your terminal and use `conda install`:

```
conda install os pandas bokeh
conda install spyder
spyder
```
I will use the `spyder` IDE for python, but Rstudio can also interpret .py scripts.   

### 1) Overview

**What are interactive plots and how do I make them?**

There is an increasing amount of out-of-the-box (ootb) solutions that require only very little prior knowledge to programming:
