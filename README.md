Hi!

Everything I present today will be referenced from this readme. I host all files and documents on github using 'pages' (e.g. this readme: https://mluerig.github.io/RR/README.md).

Additionally there will be some apps published on shiny (e.g.: https://luerig.shinyapps.io/Sample_001a) and on my personal homepage (http://www.luerig.net/files/rr). 

## Outline of my presentation:

### 1) Overview

What are interactive plots and how do I make them?

### 2) R: plotly

### 3) R: shiny

### 4) Python: bokeh

### 5) (R:) ggobi
