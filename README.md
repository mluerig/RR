# Interactive plotting

---

Hi!

**Please check the dowloads section first**

Everything I present will be referenced from this readme. I host all files and documents on github using 'github pages' (https://mluerig.github.io/RR/). 

I hope that by the time of my talk this repository will be in a shape that allows you to simply fork it and run the code along with my presentation.

### 0) Downloads

**R**

I assume you have R and Rstudio installed.
```
install.packages(c("rmarkdown","knitr" ,"ggplot2","shiny","plotly", "rgl", "rggobi"))
```

**Python (3.6)** 

If you have yet to intall python I recommend https://conda.io/miniconda.html. To install packages go to your terminal and use `conda install`:

```
conda install os pandas bokeh
```
I will use the `spyder` IDE for python, but Rstudio can also interpret .py scripts.   
```
conda install spyder
spyder
```

**Ready?**

**Good!**

### 1) Overview

There is an increasing amount of out-of-the-box solutions that require only very little prior knowledge to programming. In this section we quickly skim through a bunch of different tools - **all** are opensource! 

Many interactive plots are generated by sending data through some existing plotting environment (e.g. `ggplot` in R or `matplotlib` in Python) and presenting the results in html. The result can be static (as in non-interactive Rmarkdown doctuments) or dynamic with interactive elements. Reactive code, elements that respond to your input, change the presented output. For details refer to the `shiny` tutorial, it nicely lays out some generalities of interactive plotting: http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial/#reactivity

The product can be a locally generated html document (can be embedded online, e.g.: http://luerig.net/rr_example1/). Some companies like shiny or plotly offer host services that allow to publish "apps" (interactive figures) online: (e.g. https://luerig.shinyapps.io/Sample_001a).

Some examples with varying degrees of responsiveness:

* https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html

### 2) R: plotly

1) plotly has a neat function in R that allows you to make ggplot-objects responsive:

`ggplotly`

https://plot.ly/ggplot2/

2) There is also a native plotting function for R:

`plot_ly`

3) From Rstudio you can export your interactive plots as html, e.g.: 

### 3) R: shiny



### 4) Python: bokeh

### 5) R: ggobi
